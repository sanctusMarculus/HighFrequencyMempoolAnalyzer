<h1>HighFrequencyMempoolAnalyzer</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The <strong>HighFrequencyMempoolAnalyzerr</strong> is a simple yet quite powerfull tool developed to fetch transaction data from the mempool of Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum (ETH) networks. It offers a comprehensive solution for analyzing queued and pending transactions in real-time.</p>

<p>This analyzer is meticulously designed to optimize performance and efficiency, making it an ideal choice for both research and production environments. By utilizing a request spamming technique, it ensures rapid data retrieval from private Geth nodes while maintaining stability and reliability.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The Mempool Analyzer is versatile and easy to use. To get started, follow these simple steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including <code>libcurl</code> and <code>nlohmann/json.hpp</code>. Additionally, make sure you have access to a private Geth node server running on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) or Ethereum (ETH) network.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Compilation:</strong> Compile the source code using a C++ compiler. This will generate an executable file that you can run on your system.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Execution:</strong> Run the executable file and provide the necessary inputs, such as the RPC endpoint of the Geth node server. The analyzer will then fetch and display queued and pending transactions from the mempool in real-time.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>The Mempool Analyzer boasts several key features that set it apart:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Real-time Data Retrieval:</strong> Utilizes a request spamming technique to fetch queued and pending transactions from the mempool in real-time.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Optimized for compatibility with private Geth nodes, ensuring seamless integration and operation.</li>
  
  <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> Designed for high-performance data retrieval, enabling rapid analysis of transaction data with minimal latency.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Stability and Reliability:</strong> Built with stability and reliability in mind, providing consistent and accurate results even under heavy loads.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Concurrency Usage</h2>

<p>The Mempool Analyzer supports concurrency usage, allowing users to further enhance its capabilities and performance. By leveraging concurrency, users can execute multiple instances of the analyzer simultaneously, effectively parallelizing data retrieval and analysis tasks.</p>

<p>To modify the code for concurrency usage, consider implementing multi-threading or asynchronous programming techniques. By spawning multiple threads or tasks, you can distribute the workload across multiple cores or processing units, significantly improving throughput and responsiveness.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you can explore advanced concurrency patterns such as thread pools, futures, and promises to achieve fine-grained control over concurrency and resource utilization. These patterns offer flexibility and scalability, making them ideal for complex and demanding applications.</p>
